# energy-fault-detection
This project simulates fault-protection logic for a low-voltage energy system, 
similar to embedded safety systems used in energy and power electronics applications.

### What the system does
- Simulates voltage, current, and temperature sensor readings
- Detects unsafe conditions
    - Over-voltage
    - Over-current
    - Over-temperature
- Triggers a safe shutdown when a fault is detected
- Logs system behavior
- Includes automated test to verify over-temperature protection

Fault detection and safe shutdown logic are necessary in batter management systems, energy storage systems and other electronics.

This project demonstrates system level thinking, defensive programming and testing to validate.

### Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Sensor simulation
- Embedded systems concepts
